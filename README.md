# React Mini Projects

These are a variety of mini react projects that are done as challenges from an Online React course I'm following. I have added my own css and completed all the logic and implementation myself. The goal of this is to learn about advanced react topics like react hooks/ custom hooks, data fetching (axios), prop drilling, organized components etc.
